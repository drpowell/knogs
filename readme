knogs: keyboard navigation on google search

google used to proide a keyboard shortcuts experiment
  deprecated long ago, removed dec 2011
  the recommened replacements aren't great

  google still provides the js: https://www.google.com/js/shortcuts.5.js

knogs is a google chrome extension that provides similar functionality
  uses google's shortcuts.5.js (see above)
  google chrome only - tested on: chrome 17 on linux/64-bit

install: click on srl.user.js in google chrome

usage:
  keybindings for search: j/k: up/down, enter or (shift) o to open (in a new tab)
  places the cursor above the items (as opposed to on the far left)

bugs:
  occassional problems with focus during load
  opening an item and then using the back button doesn't set the cursor
  works partially: firefox 8.0 on linux/64-bit - focus gets screwed up

license: mit/x
  note: shortcut.5.js and googleKeyboard.js are "unlicensed" and included here for reference only
        the extension loads these directly from google at page-load
