knogs: keyboard navigation on google search

google used to provide a keyboard shortcuts experiment
  deprecated long ago, removed dec 2011
  the recommened replacements aren't great
  http://blog.nqzero.com/2011/12/googles-experimental-page-used-to-list.html
  google still provides the js: https://www.google.com/js/shortcuts.5.js

knogs is a google chrome extension that provides similar functionality
  uses google's shortcuts.5.js (see above)
  google chrome only - tested on: chrome 17+ on linux/64-bit

install via chrome store:
  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lmcekibeekmfpmhanampimjjegknceik

manual install:
  used to be able to install by clicking on knogs.user.js in google chrome
  in version 21, google made it much more difficult to install extensions
  run google with the following option
    google-chrome --enable-easy-off-store-extension-install
  then click on knogs.user.js


keybindings for search:
  'j' and 'k' navigate up and down in the search results
  'enter' or 'o' to open the selected page
  'shift-enter' or 'shift-o' to open the page in a new tab
  '/' to select the search box
  'esc' to leave the search box (when it has focus)

usage:
  places a cursor to the left of the selected item (thanks yjsoon)

bugs:
  opening an item and then using the back button doesn't set the cursor
  works partially: firefox 8.0 on linux/64-bit - focus gets screwed up

license: mit/x
  note: shortcut.5.js and googleKeyboard.js are "unlicensed" and included here for reference only
        the extension loads these directly from google at page-load
